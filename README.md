# Isaac
"The son of Samu is Isaac." It is our hope that Samu (and Isaac) will be the ancestor of developmental robotics chatter bots that will be able to chat in natural language like humans do.

## Genealogy of Isaac

1. [Samu](https://github.com/nbatfai/samu)
The main purpose of this project is to allow the evaluation and verification of the results of the paper entitled **"A disembodied developmental robotic agent called Samu Bátfai"**. It is our hope that Samu will be the ancestor of developmental robotics chatter bots that will be able to chat in natural language like humans do.
2. [Isaac](https://github.com/nbatfai/isaac)
*"The son of Samu is Isaac."* The project called Isaac is a case study of using deep Q learning with neural networks for predicting the next sentence of a conversation.
3. [Jacob](https://github.com/nbatfai/jacob)
*"The son of Isaac is Jacob."* The project called Jacob is an experiment to replace Isaac's (GUI based) visual imagination with a character console. 

## Use cases

version 0.0.1, Isaac sleeps, wakes up, then sleeps again, https://youtu.be/LQKm_43CFYM
version 0.0.2, 

# Samu
The purpose of this project is only to allow the evaluation and verification of the results of the paper entitled **"A disembodied developmental robotic agent called Samu Bátfai"**. This paper presents Q learning with neural networks approximators used by Samu. 

It is our hope that Samu will be the ancestor of developmental robotics chatter bots that will be able to chat in natural language like humans do.

## Usage 
The two use cases shown in the paper entitled **"A disembodied developmental robotic agent called Samu Bátfai"** are presented in a YouTube video at

Try another fork of this project in case you want to use Samu as a chat program. The first official fork of Samu, called Isaac, will be public soon. Isaac's repository will be available a https://github.com/nbatfai/isaac
